# Best Practices

## Palettes over Colors
When using Tailwind CSS, it's best to use palettes over colors when styling components.
This is because palettes are more flexible and can be used in multiple places,
while colors are more specific and can only be used in one place.

For example, instead of using `bg-blue-500` like:

```tsx
const Button = () => (
  <button className="bg-blue-500 text-white">Click me</button>
);
```

You should use `bg-primary` like:

```tsx
const Button = () => (
  <button className="bg-primary text-white">Click me</button>
);
```
