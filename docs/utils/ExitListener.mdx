# Exit Listener

---

The exit listener is a hook that allows developers to subscribe to
click events and escape keyboard events on a root element.

A typical example of this would be a menu, when a user opens the menu we want
to listen for events if a user clicks anywhere but our menu to notify
the parent to close it.

## Demo
<Canvas of={ExitListenerStories.Simple} sourceState="shown" />
